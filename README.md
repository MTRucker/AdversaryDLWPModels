# Adversarial Attacks on Deep Learning Weather Prediction Models

Read this thoroughly before diving into the code, as some setup is required to run this code without any problems.

Bachelor's Thesis on Adversarial Attacks on Deep Learning Weather Prediction Models

Done within the MLCS Group at the University of TÃ¼bingen

The code will be refined and cleaned up properly in the next few days, everything is currently implemented as was last left.

IT IS CURRENTLY HORRIBLY INCONSISTENT AND FUMBLED WITH A LOT OF TEMPORARY, ONE-OFF FUNCTIONS. I will try to distill it as best I can.
